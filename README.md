# MomeNikki

Welcome to Moment Nikki !

This is a UWP application which is designed to record diary at minutes' level.

本应用旨在记录以分钟为最小标记的日记.

MomeNikki is currently at an early stage of development. It supports basic adding, editing and deleting of records but that is it. I will constantly improve it until it reach my "perfect timeline diary" target.

MemoNikki还处于开发的早期阶段, 目前只有基础的增删修改功能. 不过我会渐渐完善它, 毕竟是要自己用的...

I know there are several app that dose a better job than the current MomeNikki can, but most of them are not open source, which is not that bad. However, it is the data, the storage and back up of data that is important. While most of the app (on phones or PC) store MY dairy on THEIR cloud storage, so I decided to code my own offline version. And here it is.

本应用其实没有存在的必要, 但是市场上绝大多数日记app都喜欢把数据存在他们自己的服务器里, 恕我直言,
这并不好. 但凡哪个timeline日记支持导出, 我也不会自己费劲写... (虽然也有想写个桌面端的私心在吧.)
总之, 因为对现状不满, 我决定自己写了.
## Todo List

* Export records in CSV and JSON (for user).
* Import records from Mediawiki markup (i was using my wiki as a diary).
* Allow edit of record's date & time.
* A better UI, so that it really has a timeline.
* Add a proper settings page.


* CSV JSON导出备份
* 从Mediawiki导入记录
* 对记录的日期时间进行修改
* 美工...
* 加一个正经的设置页面.
